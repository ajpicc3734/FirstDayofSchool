          Writing code can be difficult, be sure to use your problem-solving skills and avoid falling victim to extreme frustration. You will grow a lot in your programming skills throughout this course and growth can be a bumpy journey.
In addition, it is better to submit partially working code than to submit nothing at all. Trying creative solutions that donâ€™t work is better than no solution.

        </li>
        <li class="hobbies bold values-li">Be Respectful</li>
        <li class="hobbies values-li">Treat everyone with respect in this class, this includes yourself. Be kind to yourself, and allow yourself to make mistakes. Realizing your own mistakes is a valuable part of learning programming.</li>
        <li class="hobbies bold values-li">Be Honest
        </li>
        <li class="hobbies values-li">
          At times your code will look very similar to your classmate's code, and certain code snippets will be exactly the same across the board in order for it to work properly. With that being said you should never submit someone else's work (including code) and claim it as your own.

        </li>
        <li class="hobbies bold values-li">Communicate in an Honest and Open Manner</li>
        <li class="hobbies values-li">Be sure to reach out to me if you are unsure about anything or need extra assistance. Also, reach out if you anticipate needing extra time on assignments. 
          In addition, be sure to communicate effectively with your classmates, getting assistance from each other is valuable and some assignments will be collaborative.
